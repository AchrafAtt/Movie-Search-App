# Movie Search App

The **Movie Search App** is a responsive Angular application that allows users to search for movie details by providing their name and a specific year. The app fetches movie data from an API and displays information such as the movie title, actors, ratings, and poster. It includes form validation, a user-friendly interface, and is styled using **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI** for enhanced UI components.
